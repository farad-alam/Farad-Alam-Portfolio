  "bio": "I’m a full-stack developer with a unique journey into tech. My career began in affiliate marketing, where I worked extensively with WordPress. Frustrated by performance limitations and the inability to fully optimize sites, I dove into custom development — and never looked back.I specialize in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js, with expertise in React, Next.js, and Express.js. My toolkit also includes Git, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, enabling me to deliver high-performance, scalable solutions.As a developer, I’m a problem solver and creative thinker who takes pride in writing clean, scalable code. I’m driven by solving real business problems and transforming ideas into functional, impactful products.I hold a B.S. in Zoology, proving that curiosity and adaptability are at the heart of everything I do. When I’m not coding, you might find me exploring unknown roads on my bike, chasing both new paths and fresh ideas.",
